					<p style="text-align: left"> <strong>Supervisor</strong>: <em>Prof Dr Miltos Tsiantis at Max Planck Institute for Plant Breeding Research (MPIPZ, Cologne, Germany) in the <a style="color: #FF9966;" href="https://www.mpipz.mpg.de/226344/tsiantis-dpt"> "Department of Comparative Development and Genetics"</a></em> <br> I worked on a physics based approach with knowledge of solid continuum mechanics and mechanics of biological growth to model the growth and pattern of leaf of Arabidopsis thaliana. I used FEM-based mechanical simulations and am contributing in the development of C++ software MorphoDynamX for multicellular and continuous structures (steady state mechanics and growth). My work focused on solving the conundrum between the resultant growth vs specified growth. This opportunity presented me with the chance to work in collaboration with scientists of different disciplines and broadened my horizon. I also closely worked together with the <a style="color: #FF9966;"  href="https://apratimchatterji.wixsite.com/apratim"> "Soft & Living Matter Group"</a> led by Prof. Apratim Chatterji.</p>

I examined Forbush decrease data (with special emphasis on the recovery) in the context of a diffusion-expansion model, with a view to constraining the diffusion coefficients for energetic particles across magnetic fields.</p>

We aimed for a fairly simple objective — to implement a realistic boundary layer and land surface in CLiMT - an open source climate modelling framework software. Once these were written and tested, they were used to understand the effects of “large scale forcing” on the surface energy balance. I created a stepper model for calculating surface fluxes and iteratively calculate the new values of near-surface temperature and humidity. I had presented a simplified physical parameterization scheme, designed to be used with other componentis in CliMT to bridge the gap between Global Climate Models and idealized dry models. </p>

					<h2 style="text-align: left">A detailed study of Neutron Star Equation of States in Relativistic Mean Field Formalism </h2>

The relativistic mean-field approximation has been used in this study to compute the equations of state of matter within a neutron star, which is one application of nuclear physics. In particular, different known parameter sets' equations of state for nuclear and neutron star materials were constructed. I did a review of the literature that is currently accessible on neutron stars and then replicate the characteristics of saturated nuclear matter and the mass-radius relationship of a static, spherically symmetric neutron star using the derived equations of state. Results are compared to published estimates of saturated nuclear matter's characteristics and to observational data on neutron star mass-radius relationships that are currently accessible.</p>

					<h2 style="text-align: left">Effect Of Internal Composition On Neutron Star Oscillation Modes</h2>
					<p style="text-align: left"> <strong>Supervisor</strong>: <em><a style="color: #FF9966;" href="https://www.iucaa.in/en?Itemid=192">Prof Debarati Chatterjee</a> at IUCAA</em> <br> I worked on Neutron Stars, their composition (equation of state), and their effect on the gravitational waves emitted by the stars. A quantized field theoretical description of nuclei and nuclear matter in the neutron stars, called quantum hadrodynamics (QHD), based on hadronic degrees of freedom, is the current description of the equation of state. QHD is an effective theory which describes symmetric nuclear matter since hadrons are composite particles. The properties of nuclear matter are inferred from the experimentally observed properties of finite nuclei. We conducted a sensitivity study of these different nuclear parameters to determine the dependency of these on the oscillation frequency of the star's pulsations. <br> Stellar pulsations are caused by expansions and contractions in the outer layers as a star seeks to maintain equilibrium. In general, one must solve coupled fluid and space-time perturbation equations to obtain the mode frequencies. However, the situation simplifies if we consider weak gravitational fields and neglect the metric perturbations. This approach, known as the Cowling approximation, has been widely applied for studying Newtonian as well as relativistic NSs. The behaviour of matter in the interior of NSs is still not well understood. It is believed that the composition of its interior may have observable effects on its astrophysical properties, such as its mass and radius. Further, perturbations in NSs could generate gravitational waves and their waveforms could contain signatures of its internal composition. This entire work was done in the lockdown during the pandemic and led to a publication <a href="https://doi.org/10.3390/physics3020022"> (my publication)</a>. I continued the work with her in 2021 on p-modes. </p>

					<h2 style="text-align: left">Ginzburg Landau Description and Aspects of BCS Theory of Superconductivity</h2>
					<p style="text-align: left"> <strong>Supervisor</strong>: <em><a style="color: #FF9966;" href="https://www.iiserkol.ac.in/web/en/people/faculty/dps/ghosal/">Prof Amit Ghosal</a> at IISER Kolkata</em> <br> I also did quite an extensive study of Condensed Matter physics through two projects in summers of 2020 and 2021 through IISER Kolkata Online Summer Program. Superconductivity is a puzzling phenomenon discovered over a century ago and is one of the hallmarks of condensed matter physics. In this project, I tried to understand the physical description of the phenomenon through the Ginzburg Landau Model to understand superconductivity as a phase transition. We underwent mathematical rigor to explain physical hallmarks through this theory. This project involved a formulation of superconductivity according to classical mechanics, the understanding of second order phase transitions and how superconductivity can be explained as one, and the description of the Ginzburg Landau Theory and its physical consequences. In 2021, this work was extended to get the understanding the language of second quantisation which is language of quantum many body systems and its connection in the development of BCS Theory - a hallmark in Condensed Matter physics. I did a recap of first quantisation: the regular description of Quantum Mechanics. I extended the Ginzburg Landau Theory of second order phase transitions which is a very powerful tool to describe Superconductivity and discussed BCS Theory and its development from Fermi description of electron lattices. </p>

					<h2>Outreach</h2>
					<p>Beyond my academic pursuits, I actively participate in extracurricular activities and community outreach initiatives. In 2020, I had the privilege of being part of the <em>International Genetically Engineered Machine</em> (iGEM) IISER Pune team, where we dedicated ourselves to raising awareness about preventive measures and tackling drug resistance against Malaria, a deadly mosquito-borne disease caused by the Plasmodium parasite, particularly in rural areas of India. My motivation to give back to society and share scientific knowledge led me to engage with underprivileged students through the IISER Pune Social Awareness Initiative <strong>DISHA</strong>. I am also an active member of the IISER Pune Quiz Club, Astronomy Club and the Incubation Centre and Career Development Cell, where I have been involved in organizing events. This role enabled me to gain valuable exposure in administration and policy-making processes. The skills and experiences I have gained through these diverse involvements have equipped me to contribute to the creation and promotion of a healthy work culture. </p>

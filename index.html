					<h2 style="text-align: left">A Continuum Mechanical Approach to Model Leaf Growth </h2>
					<p style="text-align: left"> <strong>Supervisor</strong>: <em>Prof Dr Miltos Tsiantis at Max Planck Institute for Plant Breeding Research (MPIPZ, Cologne, Germany) in the <a style="color: #FF9966;" href="https://www.mpipz.mpg.de/226344/tsiantis-dpt"> "Department of Comparative Development and Genetics"</a></em> <br> I undertook a physics-based research project that integrated principles from solid continuum mechanics and the mechanics of biological growth to model the growth and leaf patterns of Arabidopsis thaliana.
In this pursuit, I utilized FEM-based mechanical simulations and played a pivotal role in advancing the development of <a style="color: #FF9966;"  href="https://morphographx.org/morphomechanx/">MorphoMechanX</a>, a C++ software designed for the analysis of multicellular and continuous structures, particularly in the context of steady-state mechanics and growth.
The core objective of my work was to address the intricate relationship between observed growth patterns and the predefined expectations for growth. I developed a two dimensional FEM model for visualising leaf primordia cells as a mesh of traingular elements and applied continuum mechanical principles to quantitatively study growth. This experience not only provided me with the opportunity to collaborate with scientists from various disciplines but also expanded the horizons of my knowledge and expertise. I also closely worked together with the <a style="color: #FF9966;"  href="https://apratimchatterji.wixsite.com/apratim"> "Soft & Living Matter Group"</a> led by Prof. Apratim Chatterji.</p>

					<h2 style="text-align: left">Forbush decreases in the context of a diffusion-expansion model</h2>
					<p style="text-align: left"> <strong>Supervisor</strong>: <em><a style="color: #FF9966;" href="https://www.iiserpune.ac.in/research/department/physics/people/faculty/regular-faculty/prasad-subramanian/343">Prof Prasad Subramanian</a> at IISER Pune </em> <br> I conducted a research project in Solar Astrophysics that specifically explored the behavior of galactic cosmic rays as they interact with Earth. This study revealed that these cosmic rays experience a temporary reduction in intensity, followed by a gradual recovery, when influenced by a solar coronal mass ejection known as Forbush decreases. I focused on analyzing Forbush decrease data, with particular attention given to the recovery phase, within the framework of a diffusion-expansion model. The primary goal was to gain insights into the diffusion coefficients governing the movement of energetic particles across magnetic fields. </p>

Our primary objective was straightforward: to incorporate a realistic boundary layer and land surface into CLiMT, an open-source climate modeling framework. After developing and rigorously testing these components, we applied them to investigate the impact of 'large-scale forcing' on the surface energy balance.
To facilitate this analysis, I constructed a stepper model to compute surface fluxes and continually update near-surface temperature and humidity values. I also introduced a simplified physical parameterization scheme, which is intended to integrate seamlessly with other components in CLiMT. This parameterization scheme serves as a bridge between Global Climate Models and idealized dry models.</p>

					<h2 style="text-align: left">A detailed study of Neutron Star Equation of States in Relativistic Mean Field Formalism </h2>
					<p style="text-align: left"> <strong>Supervisor</strong>: <em><a style="color: #FF9966;" href="https://www.iitr.ac.in/~PH/aruphfph">Prof P Arumugam</a> at IIT Roorkee</em> <br> I also delved into the realm of nuclear physics to gain insights into the internal composition of neutron stars (NS). To achieve this, I applied the relativistic mean-field approximation, a nuclear physics concept, to calculate the equations of state that describe the matter within a neutron star.
Specifically, I created equations of state models for both nuclear and neutron star materials using various established parameter sets. My approach involved conducting an extensive literature review on neutron stars, followed by an attempt to computationally replicate the properties of saturated nuclear matter and the mass-radius relationship of a static, spherically symmetric neutron star using the derived equations of state. The outcomes were then compared to published data concerning the properties of saturated nuclear matter and observational information on neutron star mass-radius relationships that are currently available. </p>

					<h2 style="text-align: left">Effect Of Internal Composition On Neutron Star Oscillation Modes</h2>
					<p style="text-align: left"> <strong>Supervisor</strong>: <em><a style="color: #FF9966;" href="https://www.iucaa.in/en?Itemid=192">Prof Debarati Chatterjee</a> at IUCAA</em> <br> I delved into the intricate world of Neutron Stars, focusing on understanding their composition, more specifically, their equation of state, and the implications for the gravitational waves they emit. To describe the equation of state, we employed quantum hadrodynamics (QHD), a field theoretical framework that utilizes hadronic degrees of freedom. QHD is an effective theory that particularly characterizes symmetric nuclear matter, given the composite nature of hadrons. The properties of nuclear matter are inferred from experimental observations of finite nuclei.
The behavior of matter within the interiors of Neutron Stars remains a fascinating area of study, with much yet to be understood. It is hypothesized that the star's internal composition has discernible effects on its astrophysical attributes, such as its mass and radius. Additionally, perturbations within Neutron Stars can give rise to gravitational waves, and the waveforms they produce carry signatures of the star's internal composition. </p>
These pulsations are the result of expansions and contractions in the star's outer layers as it strives to maintain equilibrium. Typically, solving the oscillation frequencies necessitates addressing coupled fluid and space-time perturbation equations. However, for scenarios involving weak gravitational fields, neglecting metric perturbations simplifies the process. This approach, known as the Cowling approximation, has been extensively applied to investigate both Newtonian and relativistic Neutron Stars.	
We built a QHD and numerical relativity model and our study comprised a sensitivity analysis of various nuclear parameters to emphasize their influence on the f-mode oscillation frequencies of the star's pulsations.
It is found that the effective nucleon in-medium mass (m*/m) to be the most dominant parameter, while the saturation density has a small non-zero effect. Variation in effective mass between 0.55–0.75 resulted in a corresponding variation of f-mode frequencies between (2–2.6) kHz as a function of neutron star (NS) masses.

					<h2 style="text-align: left">Ginzburg Landau Description and Aspects of BCS Theory of Superconductivity</h2>
					<p style="text-align: left"> <strong>Supervisor</strong>: <em><a style="color: #FF9966;" href="https://www.iiserkol.ac.in/web/en/people/faculty/dps/ghosal/">Prof Amit Ghosal</a> at IISER Kolkata</em> <br> I conducted an extensive exploration of Condensed Matter physics during the summers of 2020 and 2021 through my participation in the IISER Kolkata Online Summer Program. One of the captivating phenomena in this field is superconductivity, a puzzling discovery made over a century ago and a cornerstone of condensed matter physics.
In the first project, I embarked on a journey to unravel the physical foundation of superconductivity, employing the Ginzburg-Landau Model as a key framework to comprehend superconductivity as a phase transition. This involved rigorous mathematical analysis to interpret the physical characteristics of this phenomenon. The project encompassed the formulation of superconductivity within the realm of classical mechanics, an exploration of second-order phase transitions, and the demonstration of how superconductivity can be conceptualized as one such transition. The Ginzburg-Landau Theory and its implications in explaining superconductivity were also a focal point of this work.
In 2021, I further extended this research to delve into the language of second quantization, which forms the foundation for understanding quantum many-body systems. This extension played a pivotal role in connecting the Ginzburg-Landau Theory to the development of the BCS Theory, a seminal achievement in the field of Condensed Matter physics. I revisited the principles of first quantization, the conventional framework of Quantum Mechanics, and expanded upon the Ginzburg-Landau Theory concerning second-order phase transitions. The culmination of this effort involved a comprehensive discussion of the BCS Theory and its evolution from Fermi's description of electron lattices. </p>

					<h2>Outreach</h2>
					<p>Aside from my academic pursuits, I actively participate in extracurricular activities and community outreach programs. I achieved the title of ICSE National Level Quiz Champion in 2016 and thoroughly enjoyed engaging in various academic events.
In 2020, I had the honor of being a dedicated member of the International Genetically Engineered Machine (iGEM) team at IISER Pune. Our mission revolved around raising awareness about preventive measures and combatting drug resistance related to Malaria, a deadly mosquito-borne disease caused by the Plasmodium parasite. Our focus was particularly on rural areas in India. My unwavering motivation to give back to society and share scientific knowledge inspired me to engage with underprivileged students through the IISER Pune Social Awareness Initiative, known as DISHA.
Furthermore, I'm an active member of the IISER Pune Quiz Club, Astronomy Club, Mimamsa Organisation Team, and the Incubation Centre and Career Development Cell. The diverse skills and experiences I've gained through these involvements have equipped me to contribute to the cultivation and promotion of a dynamic and thriving work environment. </p>
